Welcome to "quick_sort"!

///// DESCRIPTION /////

This repo is an implementation of the classic quick sort algorithm in Java.  



///// BACKGROUND /////

I selected this algorithm as one of my implementation projects for my coursework because I found it the most difficult visualize at first.  Other options included bubble sort, merge sort, etc.  



///// CHALLENGES /////

As mentioned above, I found that I first needed to visually step through the execution of this sort before I could implement it.  I ended up creating a list of steps in an excel file showing each of the discrete steps.  Once I worked through this exercise, the coding wrapped up relatively quickly. 



///// LESSONS AND SKILLS LEARNED /////

This project gave me the opportunity to further improve my new Java skills.  More importantly though, it reinforced the value of planning / visualizing a solution prior to implementing it with code.  Moving forward, I will be quicker to spend time laying out the framework of how I am going to solve a problem before diving into the details.
